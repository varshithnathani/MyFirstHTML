        <h3 style="color: beige;">Eligibility criteria for ITI</h3>
        <p style="color:white;"> All those students who have completed their Xth can apply for this course and start their fitter engineering. Anyone who wants to apply for this course after their XIIth then must have science and mathematics. Your aggregate percentage should be above 40%. Any candidate that wants to apply for this course should complete their Xth from a recognized state board or CBSE. </p>
        <h3 style="color: beige;">Courses</h3>

        <!-- <p style="color: white;"> It is a transitory professional technical course, which teaches you about various types of fittings. This branch represents the mechanical branch in which you acquire knowledge of different types of machines, pipes, and structures. This is decidedly a job intend course that enables the students to get many jobs in different sectors of the industry. For example, an ITI Fitter course provides you with the knowledge of heat tempering, lathe work, drilling, grinding, and different types of bolt fittings. The course starts with basic human safety measures and advances into more technicalities of the job. This course is instead an interesting one as it is applicable in almost all the sectors of private and public institutions. You can either get the certificate by completing six months of diploma or apply for a whole year and get the degree. Although it is not as rewarding as other engineering courses, it goes on for a shorter period than the B Tech. <br> -->
        <!-- The duration of this degree is six months to 1 year. A candidate can expect a job in the public as well as the private sector. </p> -->
